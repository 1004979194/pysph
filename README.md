This codebase is the new approach for PySPH that is heavily based on
code generation. It currently supports Cython and is configured to
work in parallel.

Features
---------

  - Solver framework to add arbitrary collection of particles
  - Flexibility to define arbitrary SPH equations operating on particles
  - Seamless parallel integration using [Zoltan](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/zoltan/)

Solvers:
---------

Currently, PySPH is capable and has numerous examples to solve the
viscous, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using the weakly
compressible (WCSPH) approach. The features of the implementation are:

  - Classical WCSPH (Journal of Hydraulic Research Vol. 48 Extra Issue (2010), pp. 6â€“27)
  - Transport Velocity Formulation (Journal of Computational Physics Vol 241, May 2013, pp. 292-307)

Installation
=============

To install PySPH, you need a working Python environment. We recommend
[Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) if you
are new to Python. Additional dependencies to compile the code are:

  - Cython (ideally version 0.19 and above)
  - Mako

These can be installed from the command line using `easy_install Cython mako`

Optional dependencies:
-----------------------

If you want to use PySPH in parallel, you will need
[mpi4py](http://mpi4py.scipy.org/) and the
[Zoltan](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/zoltan/) data management library.

Building and linking PyZoltan
-------------------------------
 1. Build Zoltan with the following compile options:

 $ ../configure --with-cflags=-fPIC --enable-mpi -with-mpi-incdir=/usr/include/openmpi-x86_64 --with-mpi-libdir=/usr/lib64/openmpi/lib --prefix=/home/<username>/usr/local/Zoltan --with-mpi-compilers=/usr/lib64/openmpi/bin/

Of course, you have to provide the appropriate MPI directories on your system. 

2. Declare the environment variables `ZOLTAN_INCLUDE` and
`ZOLTAN_LIBRARY`

3. Install PySPH. The PyZoltan wrappers will be compiled and available.	
  
Running the examples
---------------------

You can verify the installation by exploring some examples:

    $ cd examples/TransportVelocity
    $ python cavity.py

This runs the driven cavity problem using the transport velocity
formulation of Adami et al. You can verify the results for the problem
using the helper script `examples/TransportVelocity/ldcavity_results.py`

The auto-generated code is put in the directory `~/.pysph/source`. A
not of caution however, it's not for the faint hearted.
